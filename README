Debian announced the candidate status of dep3 - a new guideline how to tag
patches. After converting your patches it isn't possible to use 'git-am' and
'git-format' as before to work on your patches inside git. As workaround
everybody can use small scripts to do it nevertheless.
These scripts are only small examples and shouldn't be taken as full and
complete applications. They only represent my workflow and must be heavily
modified to be useful for everybody.

`git-dep3-am` will create a new branch 'patches' on top of your current branch
and apply all patches inside your ./debian/patches/series file. Afterwards you
can hack on them and use `git-dep3-format` to create new patch files. You can
add more parameters to it which will be passed to git-log. It is for example
useful to specify another branch as your patches branch father.
`git-dep3-format experimental..patches` for example will create patches for
everything between experimental and patches heads.

It is important that the format of the commit message is target filename, blank
line and afterwards your dep3 header.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILENAME

DEP3-Header
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
fhs-paths.patch

Description: Use FHS compliant paths by default
 Upstream is not interested in switching to those paths.
 .
 But we will continue using them in Debian nevertheless to comply with
 our policy.
